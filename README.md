##Admin Report Generator
```generateAdminReport.py``` is a script which extracts any and all configurations for projects, item types, and picklists in a Jama instance using the Jama REST API. The script will output the configuration information to a file called `out.html` which can be viewed in your internet browser.

Please note that this script is distrubuted as-is as an example and will likely require modification to work for your specific use-case.  This example omits error checking. Jama Support will not assist with the use or modification of the script.

### Before you begin
- Install Python 2.7 or higher and the requests library.  [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

### Setup
1. As always, set up a test environment and project to test the script.

2. Fill out the CONFIG section of the script.  The necessary fields are:
  - ```username```
  - ```password```
  - ```base_url```

3. Fill in the following field according to the projects you wish exported:
  - ```projects``` -- A comma-separated list of project API IDs.  These are available from the Admin area in Jama, under 'Manage All Projects'. 
                         This can also be configured to `all` if you wish to export all project configuration information.
